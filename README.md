# SQL Relational Database Implementation
Fall 2024 - DATA 1050 - SQL Project

This project was completed as part of DATA 1050 (Data Engineering) and involved the design and implementation of a relational SQL database for managing structured data. I translated project requirements into a normalized database schema, defining tables and primary/foreign key relationships. The database was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) environment within Visual Studio Code using MySQL, populated with structured data, and validated through a series of SQL queries.

## Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code

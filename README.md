# SQL Relational Database Implementation
Fall 2024 - DATA 1050 - SQL Project

This project was completed as part of DATA 1050 (Data Engineering) and involved the design and implementation of a relational SQL database for managing structured data. I translated project requirements into a normalized database schema, defining tables and primary/foreign key relationships. The database was then implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) environment within Visual Studio Code using MySQL, populated with structured data, and validated by converting a set of natural-language query requirements into executable SQL queries.

## Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code

## Contents

* `SQL_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing database creation, schema implementation, and data insertion using MySQL.
* `Schema.png': Diagram illustrating the database schema and table relationships.
* `Queries.png': Project-provided natural-language questions that were translated into SQL queries.
* `Queries.sql': SQL file containing the translated queries used to validate and interact with the database.
* `Procedure_Trigger.sql': SQL file defining a stored procedure and trigger implemented as part of the project.
